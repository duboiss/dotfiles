# Dotfiles
Cross-platform dotfiles
</div>

This repository contains the majority (except my secrets) of dotfiles I use on Mac and WSL. There is not yet much automation regarding the installation/update. I try to make improvements as soon as possible.

Pull requests are welcome to fix bugs and refactoring.
